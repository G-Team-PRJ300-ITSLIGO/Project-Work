# ProjectG100-GamesFleadh2018
Entry for Games Fleadh 2018.
Backup Repository Folder (Google Drive as github was acting very weirdly during push and took ages to push, there is timestamp on files though).

Also for the build of the game, turn on V-Sync option as the game can run too fast.

---Following instructions are for files in source code---
Had to be uploaded separately due to github not allowing files bigger than 100mb.

Due to big filesize of our project, a specific folder called "Data" had to be
zipped and uploaded separately to google drive, as Github doesn't allow any single file to be over 100MB. The link to
that folder is below:

Needs to be unzipped into:
Source Code --> Library --> PlayerDataCache

so it looks like:
Source Code -->  Library --> PlayerDataCache --> Data

Another few files requires same operation as above for exactly same reasons. This zip can be extracted
straight into source code and overwrite any files when prompted.
The link is as follows:
