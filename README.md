# Project-G
This is the optimized and cleaned up version of the game.
It includes most of functionality that previous version had, without all the mess it had.
I still have two small bugs with this version that I need to fix:

1. The lighting is not working as intended until restart. At the start of the level, 
the whole scene is brighter than it should be, but after game over and restart it works as intended.

2. The enemy ships get destroyed with single shot instead of few shots as it was intended previously.
