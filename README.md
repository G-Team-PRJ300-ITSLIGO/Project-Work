# project-300
This is my 2nd version of game since start of the project. I have partially working Health System that works as a 2 part component along with Damage System. The project was packed with Winrar using splitting method as github does not allow files bigger than 25mb. To unzip, I would recommend using winrar, but all three files are needed, the .zip, z01 and z02.
